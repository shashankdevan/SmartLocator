SmartLocator
============
This android application is the product of attempts to solve an open research
problem i.e. Indoor Localization with using GPS on Mobile devices. This can 
also be viewed as a measure to save enery on the device by not polling the GPS
sensor as frequently as it would have been under normal circumstances. It uses 
Pedestrian dead reckoning algorithm to calculate the relative position of the 
device from the latest known GPS fix. 

Sensors used: GPS, ACCELEROMETER, MAGNETIC FIELD

Recommended position of device during movement: The device needs to be held in
as the user walks while moving his hand naturally. The top edge of the device 
must point in the direction of motion.
